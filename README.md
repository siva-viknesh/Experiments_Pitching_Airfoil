##Active control of separated flow on a symmetric airfoil by pitching oscillation##
<hr>

- Time-resolved particle image velocimetry and unsteady pressure measurements are carried out simultaneously to characterize the flow field over the pitching airfoil. The results presented here provide an insight into flow dynamics and the dynamic response of a stalled airfoil to pitching oscillation at different reduced frequencies.
- Data-driven aerodynamic model has been developed on a Fourier basis for a symmetrical airfoil undergoing pitching oscillation at the post-stall regime
